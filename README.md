- Express.js
- Axios
- The Movie Database (TMDb) API

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- An API key from [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) (replace the placeholder key in the code with your own).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movies-website.git
   cd movies-website
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies for the backend:**

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies for the frontend (if applicable):**

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. **Set up your TMDb API key:**

   - Open `server.js` and replace the placeholder API key with your own TMDb API key:

     ```javascript
     const apiKey = 'YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY'; // Replace with your API key
     ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the backend server:**

   ```bash
   cd server
   node server.js
   ```

   The server will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Open the frontend:**

   - Open `index.html` in your web browser.
